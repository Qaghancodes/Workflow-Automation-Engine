# Workflow Automation Engine
A solo-developed backend service automates cross-application workflows (emails, tickets, DB updates) based on triggers. Using Python (Flask) API, webhooks, and Zapier integrations, it leverages AWS Lambda and OpenAI GPT-4 to classify intent/fill forms. Data is stored in PostgreSQL. Deployed via API Gateway and GitHub Actions, it frees up human effort.
